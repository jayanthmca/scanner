Therefore, one can exceed the expected 240 bytes, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow in eir_getReceivedEIR() called by bthci_event_SendInquiryResultEvent(). In order to exploit this bug, an attacker must repeatedly connect to the victim's device in a short amount of time from different source addresses.

In Blueman before 2.1.4, the DhcpClient method of the D-Bus interface to blueman-mechanism is prone to an argument injection vulnerability. The impact highly depends on the system configuration. If Polkit-1 is disabled and for versions lower than 2.0.6, any local user can possibly exploit this. If Polkit-1 is enabled for version 2.0.6 and later, a possible attacker needs to be allowed to use the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action. That is limited to users in the wheel group in the shipped rules file that do have the privileges anyway. On systems with ISC DHCP client (dhclient), attackers can pass arguments to `ip link` with the interface name that can e.g. be used to bring down an interface or add an arbitrary XDP/BPF program. On systems with dhcpcd and without ISC DHCP client, attackers can even run arbitrary scripts by passing `-c/path/to/script` as an interface name. Patches are included in 2.1.4 and master that change the DhcpClient D-Bus method(s) to accept BlueZ network object paths instead of network interface names. A backport to 2.0(.8) is also available. As a workaround, make sure that Polkit-1-support is enabled and limit privileges for the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action to users that are able to run arbitrary commands as root anyway in /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/blueman.rules.",

When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).",

While processing the L2CAP protocol, the Bluetooth Low Energy stack of Contiki-NG needs to map an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. While looking up the corresponding channel structure in get_channel_for_cid (in os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c), a bounds check is performed on the incoming channel ID, which is meant to ensure that the channel ID does not exceed the maximum number of supported channels.However, an integer truncation issue leads to only the lowest byte of the channel ID to be checked, which leads to an incomplete out-of-bounds check. A crafted channel ID leads to out-of-bounds memory to be read and written with attacker-controlled data. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. As a workaround, Users can apply the patch in Contiki-NG pull request 2081 on GitHub.",

Versions prior to 4.9 contain a NULL Pointer Dereference in BLE L2CAP module. The Contiki-NG operating system for IoT devices contains a Bluetooth Low Energy stack.

In this structure, state information regarding credits is managed through calls to the function input_l2cap_credit in the module os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c.

By comparing the packets from a\nnormal connection and disconnection process with the testcase that\ntriggered a KASAN report. We analyzed the cause of this bug as follows:\n\n1. In the packets captured during a normal connection, the host sends a\n`Read Encryption Key Size` type of `HCI_CMD` packet\n(Command Opcode: 0x1408) to the controller to inquire the length of\nencryption key.After receiving this packet, the controller immediately\nreplies with a Command Completepacket (Event Code: 0x0e) to return the\nEncryption Key Size.\n\n2. In our fuzz test case, the timing of the controller's response to this\npacket was delayed to an unexpected point: after the RFCOMM and L2CAP\nlayers had disconnected but before the HCI layer had disconnected.\n\n3. After receiving the Encryption Key Size Response at the time described\nin point 2, the host still called the rfcomm_check_security function.\nHowever, by this time `struct l2cap_conn *conn = l2cap_pi(sk)->chan->conn;`\nhad already been released, and when the function executed\n`return hci_conn_security(conn->hcon, d->sec_level, auth_type, d->out);`,\nspecifically when accessing `conn->hcon`, a null-ptr-deref error occurred.\n\nTo fix this bug, check if `sk->sk_state` is BT_CLOSED before calling\nrfcomm_recv_frame in rfcomm_process_rx.",

Eventually\nthe whole thing blows up.\n\nFix the problem by clearing out any stale interrupts before\ninterrupts get enabled during resume.\n\nHere's a debug log of the indicent:\n[   12.042589] ieee80211 phy0: il_isr ISR inta 0x00000080, enabled 0xaa00008b, fh 0x00000000\n[   12.042625] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_irq_tasklet inta 0x00000080, enabled 0x00000000, fh 0x00000000\n[   12.042651] iwl4965 0000:10:00.0: RF_KILL bit toggled to enable radio.\n[   12.042653] iwl4965 0000:10:00.0: On demand firmware reload\n[   12.042690] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_irq_tasklet End inta 0x00000000, enabled 0xaa00008b, fh 0x00000000, flags 0x00000282\n[   12.052207] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_mac_start enter\n[   12.052212] ieee80211 phy0: il_prep_station Add STA to driver ID 31: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n[   12.052244] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_set_hw_ready hardware  ready\n[   12.052324] ieee80211 phy0: il_apm_init Init card's basic functions\n[   12.052348] ieee80211 phy0: il_apm_init L1 Enabled; Disabling L0S\n[   12.055727] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_load_bsm Begin load bsm\n[   12.056140] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_verify_bsm Begin verify bsm\n[   12.058642] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_verify_bsm BSM bootstrap uCode image OK\n[   12.058721] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_load_bsm BSM write complete, poll 1 iterations\n[   12.058734] ieee80211 phy0: __il4965_up iwl4965 is coming up\n[   12.058737] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_mac_start Start UP work done.\n[   12.058757] ieee80211 phy0: __il4965_down iwl4965 is going down\n[   12.058761] ieee80211 phy0: il_scan_cancel_timeout Scan cancel timeout\n[   12.058762] ieee80211 phy0: il_do_scan_abort Not performing scan to abort\n[   12.058765] ieee80211 phy0: il_clear_ucode_stations Clearing ucode stations in driver\n[   12.058767] ieee80211 phy0: il_clear_ucode_stations No active stations found to be cleared\n[   12.058819] ieee80211 phy0: _il_apm_stop Stop card, put in low power state\n[   12.058827] ieee80211 phy0: _il_apm_stop_master stop master\n[   12.058864] ieee80211 phy0: il4965_clear_free_frames 0 frames on pre-allocated heap on clear.\n[   12.058869] ieee80211 phy0: Hardware restart was requested\n[   16.132299] iwl4965 0000:10:00.0: START_ALIVE timeout after 4000ms.\n[   16.132303] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n[   16.132304] Hardware became unavailable upon resume.

As soon as the fence is\nsignaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed.\nThis results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the\njob pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns\na new job to the pointer.\n\nThis race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ\nexecution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns\nit to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an\ninterrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.\n\n[  466.310099] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000c0\n[  466.318928] Mem abort info:\n[  466.321723]   ESR = 0x0000000096000005\n[  466.325479]   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n[  466.330807]   SET = 0, FnV = 0\n[  466.333864]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n[  466.337010]   FSC = 0x05: level 1 translation fault\n[  466.341900] Data abort info:\n[  466.344783]   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000005, ISS2 = 0x00000000\n[  466.350285]   CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0\n[  466.355350]   GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0\n[  466.360677] user pgtable: 4k pages, 39-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000089772000\n[  466.367140] [00000000000000c0] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000, pud=0000000000000000\n[  466.375875] Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000005 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[  466.382163] Modules linked in: rfcomm snd_seq_dummy snd_hrtimer snd_seq snd_seq_device algif_hash algif_skcipher af_alg bnep binfmt_misc vc4 snd_soc_hdmi_codec drm_display_helper cec brcmfmac_wcc spidev rpivid_hevc(C) drm_client_lib brcmfmac hci_uart drm_dma_helper pisp_be btbcm brcmutil snd_soc_core aes_ce_blk v4l2_mem2mem bluetooth aes_ce_cipher snd_compress videobuf2_dma_contig ghash_ce cfg80211 gf128mul snd_pcm_dmaengine videobuf2_memops ecdh_generic sha2_ce ecc videobuf2_v4l2 snd_pcm v3d sha256_arm64 rfkill videodev snd_timer sha1_ce libaes gpu_sched snd videobuf2_common sha1_generic drm_shmem_helper mc rp1_pio drm_kms_helper raspberrypi_hwmon spi_bcm2835 gpio_keys i2c_brcmstb rp1 raspberrypi_gpiomem rp1_mailbox rp1_adc nvmem_rmem uio_pdrv_genirq uio i2c_dev drm ledtrig_pattern drm_panel_orientation_quirks backlight fuse dm_mod ip_tables x_tables ipv6\n[  466.458429] CPU: 0 UID: 1000 PID: 2008 Comm: chromium Tainted: G         C         6.13.0-v8+ #18\n[  466.467336] Tainted: [C]=CRAP\n[  466.470306] Hardware name: Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.0 (DT)\n[  466.476157] pstate: 404000c9 (nZcv daIF +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n[  466.483143] pc : v3d_irq+0x118/0x2e0 [v3d]\n[  466.487258] lr : __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x60/0x228\n[  466.492327] sp : ffffffc080003ea0\n[  466.495646] x29: ffffffc080003ea0 x28: ffffff80c0c94200 x27: 0000000000000000\n[  466.502807] x26: ffffffd08dd81d7b x25: ffffff80c0c94200 x24: ffffff8003bdc200\n[  466.509969] x23: 0000000000000001 x22: 00000000000000a7 x21: 0000000000000000\n[  466.517130] x20: ffffff8041bb0000 x19: 0000000000000001 x18: 0000000000000000\n[  466.524291] x17: ffffffafadfb0000 x16: ffffffc080000000 x15: 0000000000000000\n[  466.531452] x14: 0000000000000000 x13: 0000000000000000 x12: 0000000000000000\n[  466.538613] x11: 0000000000000000 x10: 0000000000000000 x9 : ffffffd08c527eb0\n[  466.545777] x8 : 0000000000000000 x7 : 0000000000000000 x6 : 0000000000000000\n[  466.552941] x5 : ffffffd08c4100d0 x4 : ffffffafadfb0000 x3 : ffffffc080003f70\n[  466.560102] x2 : ffffffc0829e8058 x1 : 0000000000000001 x0 : 0000000000000000\n[  466.567263] Call trace:\n[  466.569711]  v3d_irq+0x118/0x2e0 [v3d] (P)\n[  466.\n---truncated---",

That is, a route is found\nbut we hit a warning while matching it. The warning is from\nfib_info_nh() in include/net/nexthop.h because we run it on a fib_info\nwith nexthop object. The call chain is:\n inet_rtm_delroute -> fib_table_delete -> fib_nh_match (called with a\nnexthop fib_info and also with fc_oif set thus calling fib_info_nh on\nthe fib_info and triggering the warning). The fix is to not do any\nmatching in that branch if the fi has a nexthop object because those are\nmanaged separately. I.e. we should match when deleting without nh spec and\nshould fail when deleting a nexthop route with old-style nh spec because\nnexthop objects are managed separately, e.g.:\n $ ip r show 1.2.3.4/32\n 1.2.3.4 nhid 12 via 192.168.11.2 dev dummy0\n\n $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32\n $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32 nhid 12\n <both should work>\n\n $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32 dev dummy0\n <should fail with ESRCH>\n\n[1]\n [  523.462226] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n [  523.462230] WARNING: CPU: 14 PID: 22893 at include/net/nexthop.h:468 fib_nh_match+0x210/0x460\n [  523.462236] Modules linked in: dummy rpcsec_gss_krb5 xt_socket nf_socket_ipv4 nf_socket_ipv6 ip6table_raw iptable_raw bpf_preload xt_statistic ip_set ip_vs_sh ip_vs_wrr ip_vs_rr ip_vs xt_mark nf_tables xt_nat veth nf_conntrack_netlink nfnetlink xt_addrtype br_netfilter overlay dm_crypt nfsv3 nfs fscache netfs vhost_net vhost vhost_iotlb tap tun xt_CHECKSUM xt_MASQUERADE xt_conntrack 8021q garp mrp ipt_REJECT nf_reject_ipv4 ip6table_mangle ip6table_nat iptable_mangle iptable_nat nf_nat nf_conntrack nf_defrag_ipv6 nf_defrag_ipv4 iptable_filter bridge stp llc rfcomm snd_seq_dummy snd_hrtimer rpcrdma rdma_cm iw_cm ib_cm ib_core ip6table_filter xt_comment ip6_tables vboxnetadp(OE) vboxnetflt(OE) vboxdrv(OE) qrtr bnep binfmt_misc xfs vfat fat squashfs loop nvidia_drm(POE) nvidia_modeset(POE) nvidia_uvm(POE) nvidia(POE) intel_rapl_msr intel_rapl_common snd_hda_codec_realtek snd_hda_codec_generic ledtrig_audio snd_hda_codec_hdmi btusb btrtl iwlmvm uvcvideo btbcm snd_hda_intel edac_mce_amd\n [  523.462274]  videobuf2_vmalloc videobuf2_memops btintel snd_intel_dspcfg videobuf2_v4l2 snd_intel_sdw_acpi bluetooth snd_usb_audio snd_hda_codec mac80211 snd_usbmidi_lib joydev snd_hda_core videobuf2_common kvm_amd snd_rawmidi snd_hwdep snd_seq videodev ccp snd_seq_device libarc4 ecdh_generic mc snd_pcm kvm iwlwifi snd_timer drm_kms_helper snd cfg80211 cec soundcore irqbypass rapl wmi_bmof i2c_piix4 rfkill k10temp pcspkr acpi_cpufreq nfsd auth_rpcgss nfs_acl lockd grace sunrpc drm zram ip_tables crct10dif_pclmul crc32_pclmul crc32c_intel ghash_clmulni_intel nvme sp5100_tco r8169 nvme_core wmi ipmi_devintf ipmi_msghandler fuse\n [  523.462300] CPU: 14 PID: 22893 Comm: ip Tainted: P           OE     5.16.18-200.fc35.x86_64 #1\n [  523.462302] Hardware name: Micro-Star International Co., Ltd.

The busy bluetooth\ntraffic generates lots of C2H (card to host) messages, which are not\nfreed correctly.\n\nTo fix this, move the dev_kfree_skb() call in rtl8xxxu_c2hcmd_callback()\ninside the loop where skb_dequeue() is called.\n\nThe RTL8192EU leaks memory because the C2H messages are added to the\nqueue and left there forever. (This was fine in the past because it\nprobably wasn't sending any C2H messages until commit e542e66b7c2e\n(\"wifi: rtl8xxxu: gen2: Turn on the rate control\"). Since that commit\nit sends a C2H message when the TX rate changes.)\n\nTo fix this, delete the check for rf_paths > 1 and the goto. Let the\nfunction process the C2H messages from RTL8192EU like the ones from\nthe other chips.\n\nTheoretically the RTL8188FU could also leak like RTL8723BU, but it\nmost likely doesn't send C2H messages frequently enough.\n\nThis change was tested with RTL8723BU by Erhard F.

This overflow can be used to overwrite existing functions with arbitrary code. The Reserved for Future Use (RFU) bits are not discarded by eir_handleRx(), and are included in an EIR's length. Therefore, one can exceed the expected 240 bytes, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow in eir_getReceivedEIR() called by bthci_event_SendInquiryResultEvent(). In order to exploit this bug, an attacker must repeatedly connect to the victim's device in a short amount of time from different source addresses. This will cause the victim's Bluetooth stack to resolve the device names and therefore allocate buffers with attacker-controlled data. Due to the heap corruption, the name will be eventually written to an attacker-controlled location, leading to a write-what-where condition.",

In Blueman before 2.1.4, the DhcpClient method of the D-Bus interface to blueman-mechanism is prone to an argument injection vulnerability. The impact highly depends on the system configuration. If Polkit-1 is disabled and for versions lower than 2.0.6, any local user can possibly exploit this. If Polkit-1 is enabled for version 2.0.6 and later, a possible attacker needs to be allowed to use the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action. That is limited to users in the wheel group in the shipped rules file that do have the privileges anyway. On systems with ISC DHCP client (dhclient), attackers can pass arguments to `ip link` with the interface name that can e.g. be used to bring down an interface or add an arbitrary XDP/BPF program. On systems with dhcpcd and without ISC DHCP client, attackers can even run arbitrary scripts by passing `-c/path/to/script` as an interface name. Patches are included in 2.1.4 and master that change the DhcpClient D-Bus method(s) to accept BlueZ network object paths instead of network interface names. A backport to 2.0(.8) is also available. As a workaround, make sure that Polkit-1-support is enabled and limit privileges for the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action to users that are able to run arbitrary commands as root anyway in /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/blueman.rules.",

When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).",

Versions prior to 4.9 contain a NULL Pointer Dereference in BLE L2CAP module. The Contiki-NG operating system for IoT devices contains a Bluetooth Low Energy stack. An attacker can inject a packet in this stack, which causes the implementation to dereference a NULL pointer and triggers undefined behavior. More specifically, while processing the L2CAP protocol, the implementation maps an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure. In this structure, state information regarding credits is managed through calls to the function input_l2cap_credit in the module os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c. Unfortunately, the input_l2cap_credit function does not check that the metadata corresponding to the user-supplied channel ID actually exists, which can lead to the channel variable being set to NULL before a pointer dereferencing operation is performed.

Versions prior to and including 4.8 are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write that can occur in the BLE-L2CAP module. The Bluetooth Low Energy - Logical Link Control and Adaptation Layer Protocol (BLE-L2CAP) module handles fragmentation of packets up the configured MTU size. When fragments are reassembled, they are stored in a packet buffer of a configurable size, but there is no check to verify that the packet buffer is large enough to hold the reassembled packet. In Contiki-NG's default configuration, it is possible that an out-of-bounds write of up to 1152 bytes occurs. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2254 prior to the release of version 4.9.",

By comparing the packets from a\nnormal connection and disconnection process with the testcase that\ntriggered a KASAN report. We analyzed the cause of this bug as follows:\n\n1. In the packets captured during a normal connection, the host sends a\n`Read Encryption Key Size` type of `HCI_CMD` packet\n(Command Opcode: 0x1408) to the controller to inquire the length of\nencryption key.After receiving this packet, the controller immediately\nreplies with a Command Completepacket (Event Code: 0x0e) to return the\nEncryption Key Size.\n\n2. In our fuzz test case, the timing of the controller's response to this\npacket was delayed to an unexpected point: after the RFCOMM and L2CAP\nlayers had disconnected but before the HCI layer had disconnected.\n\n3. After receiving the Encryption Key Size Response at the time described\nin point 2, the host still called the rfcomm_check_security function.\nHowever, by this time `struct l2cap_conn *conn = l2cap_pi(sk)->chan->conn;`\nhad already been released, and when the function executed\n`return hci_conn_security(conn->hcon, d->sec_level, auth_type, d->out);`,\nspecifically when accessing `conn->hcon`, a null-ptr-deref error occurred.\n\nTo fix this bug, check if `sk->sk_state` is BT_CLOSED before calling\nrfcomm_recv_frame in rfcomm_process_rx.",

As soon as the fence is\nsignaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed.\nThis results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the\njob pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns\na new job to the pointer.\n\nThis race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ\nexecution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns\nit to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an\ninterrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.\n\n[  466.310099] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000c0\n[  466.318928] Mem abort info:\n[  466.321723]   ESR = 0x0000000096000005\n[  466.325479]   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n[  466.330807]   SET = 0, FnV = 0\n[  466.333864]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n[  466.337010]   FSC = 0x05: level 1 translation fault\n[  466.341900] Data abort info:\n[  466.344783]   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000005, ISS2 = 0x00000000\n[  466.350285]   CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0\n[  466.355350]   GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0\n[  466.360677] user pgtable: 4k pages, 39-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000089772000\n[  466.367140] [00000000000000c0] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000, pud=0000000000000000\n[  466.375875] Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000005 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[  466.382163] Modules linked in: rfcomm snd_seq_dummy snd_hrtimer snd_seq snd_seq_device algif_hash algif_skcipher af_alg bnep binfmt_misc vc4 snd_soc_hdmi_codec drm_display_helper cec brcmfmac_wcc spidev rpivid_hevc(C) drm_client_lib brcmfmac hci_uart drm_dma_helper pisp_be btbcm brcmutil snd_soc_core aes_ce_blk v4l2_mem2mem bluetooth aes_ce_cipher snd_compress videobuf2_dma_contig ghash_ce cfg80211 gf128mul snd_pcm_dmaengine videobuf2_memops ecdh_generic sha2_ce ecc videobuf2_v4l2 snd_pcm v3d sha256_arm64 rfkill videodev snd_timer sha1_ce libaes gpu_sched snd videobuf2_common sha1_generic drm_shmem_helper mc rp1_pio drm_kms_helper raspberrypi_hwmon spi_bcm2835 gpio_keys i2c_brcmstb rp1 raspberrypi_gpiomem rp1_mailbox rp1_adc nvmem_rmem uio_pdrv_genirq uio i2c_dev drm ledtrig_pattern drm_panel_orientation_quirks backlight fuse dm_mod ip_tables x_tables ipv6\n[  466.458429] CPU: 0 UID: 1000 PID: 2008 Comm: chromium Tainted: G         C         6.13.0-v8+ #18\n[  466.467336] Tainted: [C]=CRAP\n[  466.470306] Hardware name: Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.0 (DT)\n[  466.476157] pstate: 404000c9 (nZcv daIF +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n[  466.483143] pc : v3d_irq+0x118/0x2e0 [v3d]\n[  466.487258] lr : __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x60/0x228\n[  466.492327] sp : ffffffc080003ea0\n[  466.495646] x29: ffffffc080003ea0 x28: ffffff80c0c94200 x27: 0000000000000000\n[  466.502807] x26: ffffffd08dd81d7b x25: ffffff80c0c94200 x24: ffffff8003bdc200\n[  466.509969] x23: 0000000000000001 x22: 00000000000000a7 x21: 0000000000000000\n[  466.517130] x20: ffffff8041bb0000 x19: 0000000000000001 x18: 0000000000000000\n[  466.524291] x17: ffffffafadfb0000 x16: ffffffc080000000 x15: 0000000000000000\n[  466.531452] x14: 0000000000000000 x13: 0000000000000000 x12: 0000000000000000\n[  466.538613] x11: 0000000000000000 x10: 0000000000000000 x9 : ffffffd08c527eb0\n[  466.545777] x8 : 0000000000000000 x7 : 0000000000000000 x6 : 0000000000000000\n[  466.552941] x5 : ffffffd08c4100d0 x4 : ffffffafadfb0000 x3 : ffffffc080003f70\n[  466.560102] x2 : ffffffc0829e8058 x1 : 0000000000000001 x0 : 0000000000000000\n[  466.567263] Call trace:\n[  466.569711]  v3d_irq+0x118/0x2e0 [v3d] (P)\n[  466.\n---truncated---",

That is, a route is found\nbut we hit a warning while matching it. The warning is from\nfib_info_nh() in include/net/nexthop.h because we run it on a fib_info\nwith nexthop object. The call chain is:\n inet_rtm_delroute -> fib_table_delete -> fib_nh_match (called with a\nnexthop fib_info and also with fc_oif set thus calling fib_info_nh on\nthe fib_info and triggering the warning). The fix is to not do any\nmatching in that branch if the fi has a nexthop object because those are\nmanaged separately. I.e. we should match when deleting without nh spec and\nshould fail when deleting a nexthop route with old-style nh spec because\nnexthop objects are managed separately, e.g.:\n $ ip r show 1.2.3.4/32\n 1.2.3.4 nhid 12 via 192.168.11.2 dev dummy0\n\n $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32\n $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32 nhid 12\n <both should work>\n\n $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32 dev dummy0\n <should fail with ESRCH>\n\n[1]\n [  523.462226] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n [  523.462230] WARNING: CPU: 14 PID: 22893 at include/net/nexthop.h:468 fib_nh_match+0x210/0x460\n [  523.462236] Modules linked in: dummy rpcsec_gss_krb5 xt_socket nf_socket_ipv4 nf_socket_ipv6 ip6table_raw iptable_raw bpf_preload xt_statistic ip_set ip_vs_sh ip_vs_wrr ip_vs_rr ip_vs xt_mark nf_tables xt_nat veth nf_conntrack_netlink nfnetlink xt_addrtype br_netfilter overlay dm_crypt nfsv3 nfs fscache netfs vhost_net vhost vhost_iotlb tap tun xt_CHECKSUM xt_MASQUERADE xt_conntrack 8021q garp mrp ipt_REJECT nf_reject_ipv4 ip6table_mangle ip6table_nat iptable_mangle iptable_nat nf_nat nf_conntrack nf_defrag_ipv6 nf_defrag_ipv4 iptable_filter bridge stp llc rfcomm snd_seq_dummy snd_hrtimer rpcrdma rdma_cm iw_cm ib_cm ib_core ip6table_filter xt_comment ip6_tables vboxnetadp(OE) vboxnetflt(OE) vboxdrv(OE) qrtr bnep binfmt_misc xfs vfat fat squashfs loop nvidia_drm(POE) nvidia_modeset(POE) nvidia_uvm(POE) nvidia(POE) intel_rapl_msr intel_rapl_common snd_hda_codec_realtek snd_hda_codec_generic ledtrig_audio snd_hda_codec_hdmi btusb btrtl iwlmvm uvcvideo btbcm snd_hda_intel edac_mce_amd\n [  523.462274]  videobuf2_vmalloc videobuf2_memops btintel snd_intel_dspcfg videobuf2_v4l2 snd_intel_sdw_acpi bluetooth snd_usb_audio snd_hda_codec mac80211 snd_usbmidi_lib joydev snd_hda_core videobuf2_common kvm_amd snd_rawmidi snd_hwdep snd_seq videodev ccp snd_seq_device libarc4 ecdh_generic mc snd_pcm kvm iwlwifi snd_timer drm_kms_helper snd cfg80211 cec soundcore irqbypass rapl wmi_bmof i2c_piix4 rfkill k10temp pcspkr acpi_cpufreq nfsd auth_rpcgss nfs_acl lockd grace sunrpc drm zram ip_tables crct10dif_pclmul crc32_pclmul crc32c_intel ghash_clmulni_intel nvme sp5100_tco r8169 nvme_core wmi ipmi_devintf ipmi_msghandler fuse\n [  523.462300] CPU: 14 PID: 22893 Comm: ip Tainted: P           OE     5.16.18-200.fc35.x86_64 #1\n [  523.462302] Hardware name: Micro-Star International Co., Ltd.

The busy bluetooth\ntraffic generates lots of C2H (card to host) messages, which are not\nfreed correctly.\n\nTo fix this, move the dev_kfree_skb() call in rtl8xxxu_c2hcmd_callback()\ninside the loop where skb_dequeue() is called.\n\nThe RTL8192EU leaks memory because the C2H messages are added to the\nqueue and left there forever. (This was fine in the past because it\nprobably wasn't sending any C2H messages until commit e542e66b7c2e\n(\"wifi: rtl8xxxu: gen2: Turn on the rate control\"). Since that commit\nit sends a C2H message when the TX rate changes.)\n\nTo fix this, delete the check for rf_paths > 1 and the goto. Let the\nfunction process the C2H messages from RTL8192EU like the ones from\nthe other chips.\n\nTheoretically the RTL8188FU could also leak like RTL8723BU, but it\nmost likely doesn't send C2H messages frequently enough.\n\nThis change was tested with RTL8723BU by Erhard F.

In a driver that binds to other interfaces, ISOC\nand DIAG, this is an accident waiting to happen.\n\nThe issue is revealed in btusb_disconnect(), where calling\nusb_driver_release_interface(&btusb_driver, data->intf) will have devm\nfree the data that is also being used by the other interfaces of the\ndriver that may not be released yet.\n\nTo fix this, revert the use of devm and go back to freeing memory\nexplicitly.",
